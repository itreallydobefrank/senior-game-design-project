EXO RUSH

This is my senior game design project. The goal of this game is to complete each level by navigating obstacles to get to the finish area. Turrets will shoot at you while you navigate each level. The game ends when all levels are complete or the player health reaches zero.

A full build of this project can be made by opening it and building it in unity.

A full list of controls can be viewed by starting the game and pushing the P key.

My team members are listed under the contributors for the project.

Music is done by Mitchell Dixon.
